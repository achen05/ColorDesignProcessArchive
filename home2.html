Funny Dreams
</p>
<p class="poemText">
In the fading light of the sunset, you see three shadowy figures in the distant horizon. A cowboy, his horse, and a dog. The cowboy is riding his horse across the horizon and not far behind, the dog chases after the cowboy and his horse, the distance between the two becoming greater with every stride. When the light of the sun is moments away from completely vanishing, the sky has no stars and no moon. You continue to watch as the night slowly swallows the three figures in the distance and eventually all that is left is a vast, true black. You can still hear the dog's bark as it continues to chase after the cowboy and his horse in the black of the night. You laugh a little and smile. "Stupid dog."

      This year has been a struggle. Art school was a new and exciting place for me. I got stressed out feeling like a fish out of water. I felt out of place, I felt like I didn’t belong. I felt like I shouldn’t go be here, but with each project, it got easier. These are the five projects I had to do in my color class. This is how I felt about all of them.
    </p>
    <p class="poemText">
      1. I started off feeling anxious as if I was doing everything wrong. I didn’t know about colors. I looked at a color wheel three times in my life. We had to create a color wheel out of objects. How interesting. Maybe this isn’t so bad, maybe this will be okay.
    </p>
    <p class="poemText">
      2. What is hot glue? We have to create a website? I get to show off my art to everyone maybe they’ll like it, maybe they’ll think it’s cool. Maybe this isn’t so bad
    </p>
    <p class="poemText">
      3. Who is Albers? What am I supposed to be doing? Adobe illustrator never used that before, what am I gonna do. How am I gonna do this? I need help. Wait I figured it out, they made me feel better. Maybe this isn’t so bad
    </p>
    <img src="Albers assignment.jpg" alt="" class="projectImage">
    <p class="poemText">
      4. Surface scratch what is that. How am I gonna make this look good? I’m so confused about what I’m supposed to do. I go about everything differently than everyone else. What if I take inspiration from movements. What if I do something with masks. Below the surface, yeah I like that idea. Maybe this isn’t gonna be so bad.
    </p>
    <p class="poemText">
      5. For the last project, I haven’t done anything, why did I choose a film. I don’t know how to do a film. I made this too hard for myself again. Why do I do this. I can do this, I will get through this maybe this isn’t so bad.
    </p>
    <p class="poemText">
      With the end of the semester, I’m looking back at where I was and where I am now. I’m not as scared anymore. I know what I’m doing. I feel like I belong finally, maybe this is what I’m supposed to be doing with my life. This isn’t so bad.

      Mayfly</p>
      <p class="poemText">
The words go incomplete as the sentence, unfinished<br>
An idea comes as quick as it is diminished
</p>
<p class="poemText">
The beginning, way too oversaturated for the young eye<br>
The words breathing, living as long as a healthy Mayfly
</p>
<p class="poemText">
They went up, handing it to her through the narrowly opened door<br>
The subject creating misconception, more unclear than before
</p>
<p class="poemText">
A dog with its legs too petite for its demeanor <br>
A crowd of students give wide berth to their substitute teacher
</p>
<p class="poemText">
Like a saint forcing their good intentions, redundant<br>
The lies becoming more and more abundant
</p>
<p class="poemText">
Like receiving an answer in a long forgotten dream
